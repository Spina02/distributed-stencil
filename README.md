# Parallel 5-Point Stencil Computation (Work in Progress)

This project is an implementation of a parallel 5-point stencil computation to solve the Heat Equation. The final implementation will use a hybrid MPI and OpenMP approach.

**This project is currently under development.**

## Goal

The main goal is to develop a parallel solver for the Heat Equation using a 5-point stencil on a 2D grid. The project involves:
- Parallelization using MPI for distributed memory and OpenMP for shared memory.
- Performance analysis through strong and weak scaling studies.
- Instrumentation to measure computation and communication time.
